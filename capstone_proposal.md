## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

Kiva Microfunds, (more commonly known as Kiva.org) is an online, non-profit crowdfunding initiative created to extend financial services to the poor and financially excluded around the world - in particular low-income entrepreneurs and students. Over $1 billion in loans have thus far been provided to over 2 million people through the platform, with a repayment rate of between 98 and 99 per cent. Kiva does not collect any interest on the loans it facilitates and Kiva lenders to not make interest on loans.

For the purposes of setting investment priorities, helping to inform lenders and understanding target communities, knowing the level of poverty of each borrower is critical. However, this requires inference based on the very limited data available to us on the characteristics of each borrower.

In Kaggle's first 'Data Science for Good' challenge, Kiva invited the Kaggle community to help them build more localised models for the purposes of estimating the poverty levels of residents in the regions where Kiva has active loans.

#### Motivation

My personal motivation for undertaking this project in particular stems from my background and prior experience with microcredit and microfinance. My ethnic roots (and, indeed, the country I lived in for two years of my life) lie in Bangladesh, the nation in which Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus pioneered microfinance. I completed a research project in Dhaka with one of the largest providers of microcredit loans, and while it is not the 'silver bullet' against poverty it was once touted as being, it may still have great potential as a policy tool. I am in particular interested in how adding technology and the latest crowdfunding trends to the traditional microcredit model in order to leverage global goodwill might lead to a reduction in poverty.


### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

For the locations in which Kiva has active loans, the objective is to estimate the welfare level of borrowers in specific regions, based on shared economic and demographic characteristics, on as granular a level as possible. Ideally the solution will leverage information such as the borrowers gender, average welfare metrics in the area, and borrowing behaviour in order to estimate the borrowers welfare level.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.



### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**

- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?
- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?
